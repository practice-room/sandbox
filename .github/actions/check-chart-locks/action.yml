name: Check Chart Locks
description: |
  Checks for the existence of chart-name in a given chart lock file. If a chart
  is found to be locked at the URL searched, the lockpath is returned should the
  caller need it for further evaluation.

  Designed to work with OWNERS file merges to prevent chart naming conflicts.
inputs:
  # e.g. vault
  chart-name:
    required: true
    description: 
      The chart name to be locked.
  # e.g. https://charts.openshift.io/chart-locks.json
  lockfile-url-override:
    required: false
    description:
      The exact URL for the lock file used for comparison. Ignored
      if executing within openshift-helm-charts/charts. Internally defaulted
      if empty.
  fail-workflow-if-locked:
    required: false
    default: 'false'
    description: |
      Forces a failure of this action when the chart is locked. Must explicitly
      be set to the value 'true'. All other values (even a boolean true) are
      considered false.
outputs:
  # e.g. true/false
  chart-is-locked:
    description: Whether the chart provided via the chart-name input is locked
    value: ${{ steps.set-lock-state.outputs.chart-is-locked }}
  # e.g. charts/category/vendor/chartname if package-is-locked is true, otherwise null
  locked-to-path:
    description: The path to which a locked chart is locked.
